# UI/UX Enhancement for FOSSEE Workshop Portal

## Project Overview

This project aimed to enhance the user interface (UI) and user experience (UX) of the FOSSEE Workshop Portal. The primary goal was to create a more modern, responsive, and user-friendly design, with a focus on improving the experience for mobile users.

## Changes Made

The following changes were made to the project:

### 1. `base.css` (`workshop_app/static/workshop_app/css/base.css`)

- **Typography:**
    - Set the default font to 'Roboto' from Google Fonts for better readability.
    - Defined base font sizes and colors for the body.

- **Navbar:**
    - Updated the navbar with a modern, light color scheme.
    - Added a subtle box shadow to make the navbar stand out.
    - Styled the navbar links for better visual hierarchy.

- **Footer:**
    - Redesigned the footer to include more information, such as links to social media and other important pages.
    - Improved the styling of the footer for a more professional look.

- **Card Styles:**
    - Added styles for cards, which can be used to display content in a more organized and visually appealing way.

- **Button Styles:**
    - Added styles for buttons to make them more consistent and visually appealing.

### 2. `base.html` (`workshop_app/templates/workshop_app/base.html`)

- **Google Fonts:**
    - Added a link to the Google Fonts stylesheet for the 'Roboto' font.

- **Navbar:**
    - Updated the navbar HTML to reflect the new design.
    - Ensured the navbar is fully responsive and collapses correctly on smaller screens.

- **Footer:**
    - Updated the footer HTML to include the new content and links.

## Technical Details

- **Frameworks:** The project is built on the Django web framework.
- **UI Framework:** The UI is built using Bootstrap 4, a popular CSS framework for building responsive, mobile-first websites.
- **Fonts:** The 'Roboto' font from Google Fonts is used for improved readability.

## Future Recommendations

- **Component-Based Design:** For future development, consider breaking down the UI into smaller, reusable components. This will make the code easier to maintain and scale.
- **JavaScript Framework:** For more complex and interactive features, consider using a JavaScript framework like React or Vue.js.
- **Accessibility:** While the current changes have improved accessibility, it's important to continue to follow best practices for accessibility to ensure the website is usable by everyone.
